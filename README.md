### Challenges of this Project:
This project was originally designed to be a database for the online card game, Hearthstone, using the Hearthstone API.  Unfortunately, after about two days os work, I realized many of the data sets had issues like broken image links or incomplete data and it was very difficult to visualize a great end product with these problems.  Since this project was done on a deadline, I looked for something that could change the theme of the site without needing huge changes to the voerall structure.  For this reason, the Pokemon TCG API seemed like a good fit as it was also a card game with a plethora of data on the game. 

However, while the data coming back was of better quality, some endpoints would not return a response at times.  I am currently in contact with the moderator of the APIs site trying to see if I can get more information on this issue.
